# Redux Todos using Material-UI
- This is a modification to my last to list example. The only difference is that I am using Redux with React to manage the state of the app.
- This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.
